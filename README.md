## Introduction

This is a power Bi project on Covid 19 analysis in the world called **Covid Cases by Country - 2023**. The project is to analyze and derive insights to answer critical questions and issues.
**_Disclaimer_**: _The dataset are gotten from kaggle just to demostrate my capabilities on Power BI._

## Problem Statement
1. What is the top 5 countries with the highest cases?
2. What is the top 5 countries with the highest death rate?
3. What is the top 5 countries with the highest test?
4. What is the top 5 countries with the highest recovered and death cases?

## Skills and concepts demonstrated:

The following Power BI features were incorporated-
_Bookmarking
_DAX
_Page navigation
_New measures
_Modelling
_Filters

## Modelling:
The dataset is just a table, so i didnt any modelling.

## Conclusions
Based on the comprehensive analysis of the covid dataset, I have uncovered valuable insights into some part of the world surferring from critical impacts from the virus. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the rate at which the viruses affect individual country, regional dynamics, , and factors influencing lost of lives. The data-driven approach has allowed us to identify trends and insights.
